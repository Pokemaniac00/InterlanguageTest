Interlanguage Testing

This repository presents an executable Shell file that calls upon Java and Python files that
interact with eachother to multiply random integers and print the result.

The process is described as below:

Write.java will choose 2 random integers and write them to a mediator text file.
Interpret.py will read and multiply the 2 integers and append the result to the mediator.
Read.java reads the mediator and displays the result of the mathematical operation.
